# Emoys

Emoys is an emotion engine based on current scientific litterature. 

The code contains a demonstration as a Unity mini game. 
The user controls a ball which represents the character emotional state. 
When the ball is colliding with the cubes on the map, the emotion/mood of the cube is added to the current mood of the character, allowing the user to witness the different emotional changes in real time.
